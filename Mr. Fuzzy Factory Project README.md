- The marketing sources "gsearch" and "brand search" have a consistent session to order conversion rate growth since 2012. This data proves the effectiveness of "gsearch" and "brand search". The company should consider a budget increase for these two sources. 
-  The marketing source "bsearch" session to order conversion rate decreased in 2014 as opposed to 2013. This data should be monitored to reconsider future investment's action. 
- The marketing source "organic search", session to order conversion rate, consistently increased since 2012. This means that “Mr. Fuzzy” brand became more popular, and clients search for the brand directly in the search engine. This phenomenon can assist the company to decrease marketing expenses in the future. 

The bottom graph focuses on the device type used by sessions in the marketing source "gsearch": 
- Both sections, "Sessions" and "Orders", showcase a consistent website activity growth of desktop users vs mobile device since 2012.
